### Data sources
Gold/USD price data for 1950-2017 was sourced from [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/core/gold-prices). Gold/USD price data for 2018-2023 was sourced from [goldprice.org](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html). I also crosschecked the price history against data from [macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart) to ensure it was broadly accurate.

The median wage data came from the St. Louis Federal Reserve: [Employed full time: Median usual weekly nominal earnings (second quartile): Wage and salary workers: 16 years and over](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252881500Q)
